This work was done as part of my initial learning in the area of sentiment analysis during my masters at IIT Bombay. It contains the summary of my attemps at understanding the area during my initial days of research. I do not claim any of it as my original work. This seminar is supposed to be a compilation of the famous published works at the time. I have tried to give proper references wherever possible. This seminar may serve as a starting point for someone looking to understand the area of sentiment analysis. The latex stylesheet I used for this report is also not my IP and I do *not* recommend its use unless a benefactor is sure about its license and permissions.

\chapter{Sentiment Analysis on Social Media}\label{ch:saosm}
%************************************************
In the past few years, there has been a huge growth in the use of microblogging
platforms such as Twitter and social networks like Facebook. People now spend more time on social networks than any other thing on the internet.
Social networks have provided them the platform that not only allows them to connect with friends but also to express themselves, voice their opinions, broadcast themselves
over the internet and build reputation. Thus, the content generated on these social networks is highly diverse. In the current scenario, it will not be an overstatement to say that people
post about anything and everything. According to a report from Business Insider, Facebook has 1.2 billion monthly active users. With such an amount of activity, there is hardly
any information about the people that the social networks are missing out on. Spurred by the growth of social networks, companies and media organizations are increasingly seeking ways to mine social media for information about
what people think and feel about their products and services.

While we establish that social media analysis is crucial for latest trends and feedbacks, it is to be realized that sentiment analysis on social media comes with its own complexities. 
The expression of sentiments is different in social media than say, movie reviews. This is due to the informal language, inexplicit context and message-length constraints (esp. Twitter) of social network domain.
As a result, features such as automatic part-of-speech tags and resources such as sentiment lexicons are less useful for sentiment analysis in social networks.
Another challenge of microblogging and social media posting is the incredible breadth of topic that is covered. In social media, hardly ever will we find people adhering
to a single issue. Usually they touch multiple areas and to recognize what is information and what is noise is the first challenge that sentiment systems have to face. To be able to build systems that mine the likes of Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn etc, the conventional sentiment analysis approaches won't work. In this chapter we will see in detail why. In the next chapter, the special tools and solutions are discussed
that will make sentiment analysis on social networks viable.


\section{Taxonomy of Social Networks}

Social media has become the new corpus for sentiment analysis. However, different kinds of networks have their own characteristics and purpose, and may demand different treatment.
Thus, it becomes important to understand the different types of social networks and the relationships among them.

\subsection{Social Connections}

These are the services that connect people with other people of similar interests and background, usually to the people they know outside the web also.
Usually they consist of a user profile, where a user updates his latest activities. People from his/her social group can see them, and communicate back.
Sometimes these networks also provide the ability to setup groups or personal chat, on case one wants to go secretive for a while. The most popular are Facebook, Google+ and MySpace.

\vspace{8mm}

LinkedIn also falls in the same domain although it differs from the given examples in the sense that the language here is more formal.

\subsection{Microblogging}

Services that focus on short updates that are pushed out to anyone subscribed to receive the updates. These networks are used primarily by celebrities
and brands that seek to build a reputation by gathering followers. The most popular is Twitter.

\subsection{Social News}

Social news are collaborative content building networks where every user contributes to the generation and organization of information.
Services like these allow people to post various articles of their own or otherwise or links to outside articles and then allows it’s users to vote on the items.
The voting is the core social aspect as the items that get the most votes are displayed the most prominently. 
The community decides which news items get seen by more people. The most popular are Digg, Reddit and Quora.
 
\subsection{Media Sharing}

Media sharing services primarily provide a platform to share and distribute the likes of videos, photos and other forms of media on the internet. Even these kind of services are not
bereft of social network structure. For example, in Instagram, you can share a photo with friends, just like on Facebook, and they can then like or comment or you can
just broadcast your photo for everybody to see.

\subsection{Discussion Forums}

Discussion forums are more inclined towards a specific topic of discussion. They usually have threads of conversation about a particular subject or topic. If you have something
different to say, a new thread should be created. For example, StackOverflow. However, not all such forums keep track of user information. In such cases, the social network
structure doesn't apply.

Given the above classification, it is to be understood that there are non-trivial overlaps between most of the mentioned categories. For instance, Facebook provides a kind of microblogging 
type feature in the form of statuses. \cite{url:3}

\section{Importance of Social Media}

Awareness is one of the key ingredients to success in industry. If one needs to survive in the market, he/she must know the demands of its consumer as well as the response to its 
products or services at all times. Ever since sentiment analysis on social media has been possible, companies have become very enthusiastic to use this for themselves. The
advantages are multifarous. One, they get to connect to their customers directly. Second, they are always getting an immediate feedback on whatever they do or fail to do. Moreover, since no data
on social networks is hidden whatsoever, they can also find out about their rival companies and plan accordingly.

\subsection{Brand Assessment}

For the past few years, a lot of startups emerged offering sentiment analysis services to companies. Also, the companies are adopting these technologies at a great pace. Many of
the established firms (e.g. Google, Adobe) have developed their own systems to do the same. The idea is simple. The more informed you are, the better decisions you can take.

\subsection{Social Media Marketing}

Facebook conducted a massive psychological experiment on 689,003 users, manipulating their news feeds to assess the effects on their emotions. The details of the experiment
were published in an article entitled “Experimental Evidence Of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks” published in the journal 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. In simple words, Facebook has the ability to make you feel good or bad, 
just by tweaking what shows up in your news feed.

However, this was not the first time something of this kind was seen. The idea of emotional contagion is much older, which can be stated simply as 
“The sentiment of a social media author influences the sentiment of people in his social media network”. Now, from a company's prespective this can be very useful. If they can
sway the emotion of people towards their side, it can do wonders for them. This is what has given rise to a new form of marketing called social media marketing. Hence, there is 
immense competition between companies to mark their influence on the social media.

\section{Challenges posed by social media}

Sentiment analysis on social media is not straightforward as say, on movie reviews. There is a whole set of problems that researchers have faced. Some of them are:

\subsection{Lack of Specificity in Context}

People don't conform to any standards or guidelines while writing on social networks. They just go by the famous phrase - "What's on your mind?". Since there is no control whatsoever,
it usually becomes very difficult to extract the required and leave the rest. Technically, the miners have to deal with a lot of noise here.

For example:

\vspace{8mm}

\textbf{I haven't studied a word since I brought my new Sony Playstation home. My mom hates it!}

\vspace{8mm}

Here, even if the author of the post is talking about Sony Playstation, this is not a valid review for the same.

\subsection{Highly informal language}

Language on the social networks is not something we can call English , or any other language for that matter. People post according to their own comfort, at their own leisure.
Also, there is something called intensifiers, which is a technical name for purposefully misspelling a word to increase its intensity.

For instance,

\vspace{8mm}

\textbf{I totallllyyyy looovve my new Playstation!}

\vspace{8mm}

Note that these kind of things are difficult to handle. Still, they cannot be ignored since they are major carriers of sentiment.

\subsection{Social network specific entities}

Consider this example,

\vspace{8mm}

\textbf{I support \#ProteaFire.}

\vspace{8mm}

Now, without the knowledge that \#ProteaFire was a hashtag circulated to support Republic of South Africa in Cricket World Cup'15, this statement hardly makes sense.
But as we have this information, this post suddenly becomes meaningful. When we are working in the social media domain, these kind of entities are our primary target, in fact.

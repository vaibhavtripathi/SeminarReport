\chapter*{Abstract}
Sentiment analysis is the art of detecting sentiment, opinion or emotion from a piece of text.
With the proliferation of social networks, there is now a large amount of
opinionated text available on the internet.
In recent years, opinionated postings in social media
have helped reshape businesses, and sway public sentiments and emotions, impacting our social and political systems.
However, sentiment analysis on social media is a challenging task. 
This report discusses the problems in sentiment analysis in general and sentiment analysis on social media in particular 
and suggests some solutions.
